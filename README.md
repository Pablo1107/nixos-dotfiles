# pablo1107's dotfiles

This are my stow managed dotfiles, for big configurations (like vim or wm's)
I use git submodules. 

## Setup
Run the setup.sh

```bash
  ./setup.sh
```

This will update all submodule to the latest commit of each repo and will set
an alias called `git subpull` that will let you do this effortless.

```bash
  git subpull
```
